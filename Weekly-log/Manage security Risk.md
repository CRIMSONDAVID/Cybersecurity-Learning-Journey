1. Frameworks
Definition: Structured blueprints for managing cybersecurity risks.

Importance: Provide guidance, structure, communication, and compliance alignment.

Analogy: The architectural plan for building a house.

2. Controls
Definition: Specific safeguards or countermeasures that implement frameworks.

Types:
Administrative: Policies, training, procedures.
Technical: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, encryption, MFA.
Physical: Locks, guards, cameras, biometrics.
Analogy: The actual locks, doors, and cameras installed in the house.

3. Frameworks + Controls Relationship
Frameworks = the “what” and “why.”
Controls = the “how.”

4. CIA Triad
Confidentiality: Prevent unauthorized access.

Integrity: Ensure accuracy and trustworthiness.

Availability: Keep systems accessible.

5. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
Voluntary, risk-based, globally adopted.
Five Core Functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
Importance: Provides a comprehensive, flexible approach to risk management.

6. OWASP Security Principles
Focus: Web application security.
Community-driven resources: Guides, tools, methodologies.
Importance: Helps developers prevent common web vulnerabilities.

7. Security Audits
Definition: Independent examinations of security controls and processes.
Key Elements: Scope & goals, risk assessment, controls assessment, compliance, communication of results.
Examples: GDPR, PCI DSS.
Importance: Identifies weaknesses, ensures compliance, and drives continuous improvement.

Why This Matters
Cybersecurity isn’t just technical — it’s strategic. Frameworks guide us, controls enforce protection, the CIA triad helps us prioritize, and audits keep us accountable. Together, they form the backbone of resilient organizations.

I completed structured audit exercises that taught me how to identify assets, assess risks, evaluate threats, and review existing controls. I practiced using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to organize audit findings.
