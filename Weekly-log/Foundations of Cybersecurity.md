Foundations of Cybersecurity
I explored the foundations of cybersecurity, diving into four modules that gave me both theoretical grounding and practical insights.

Module 1: Welcome to the World of Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is not just about firewalls and antivirus — it’s about protecting people, systems, and trust.

Human error is often the biggest vulnerability, which makes awareness and training just as important as technology.

The role of a cybersecurity analyst is dynamic: monitoring, analyzing, responding, and educating.

Reflection: I realized cybersecurity is more than a career path — it’s a mindset built on curiosity, responsibility, and ethics.

Module 2: The Evolution of Cybersecurity
Learned the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) as the backbone of security.

Understood that not all assets are equal — customer data and reputation often outweigh hardware in value.

Frameworks like NIST CSF provide structure, while controls (technical, administrative, physical) bring them to life.
Reflection: Cybersecurity is systematic. It’s about prioritizing what matters most and applying structured defenses.

Module 3: Protecting Against Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities
Explored the CISSP eight security domains — from risk management to software development security.

Realized that cybersecurity is an ecosystem: each domain supports the others.

Example: Identity management is useless without secure networks, and testing is meaningless without ongoing operations.

Reflection: True resilience comes from a holistic approach, not isolated fixes.

Module 4: Cybersecurity Tools and Programming Languages
Logs are the “black box” of digital systems — essential for detection, investigation, and compliance.

Tools like SIEMs, playbooks, and packet analyzers are the lifeline of modern security operations.

Began exploring Linux, SQL, and Python — the everyday toolkit for automation, investigation, and problem-solving.

Reflection: Tools are powerful, but they’re only as effective as the analyst using them. Critical thinking and curiosity make the difference.

Key Takeaway from Week 1
Cybersecurity isn’t just about technology — it’s about structured thinking, ethical responsibility, and continuous learning. This first week gave me a roadmap of the field and the confidence to keep building layer by layer.
